Hello! This set up is pretty basic, I used the Vue CLI to initiate a project with vue 2.xx.

## Project setup
### NPM not installed yet
if npm isnt installed yet, have to install it via homebrew in the terminal on a mac.

Paste the following in a macOS Terminal prompt.
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

This will install Homebrew on your Mac. To check the version type the following command.
brew -v

Type following command to install node
brew install node

To check npm version / see if its installed
npm -v

### NPM already installed but vuecli and yarn isnt.
If yarn and vuecli isn't installed yet but npm already is, please follow the next steps

Step 1.
npm install --global yarn

Step 2.
npm install -g @vue/cli
# OR

yarn global add @vue/cli

## Starting the project
- run yarn serve in the terminal
